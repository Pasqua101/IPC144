1.There were several benefits and advantages of being able to use user-defined structures in this workshop One of the advantages that I experienced, was that if I had to change the name of a variable in a certain part of my code. I would only have to change a couple of lines that used that specific name. I was able to keep any other reference to the variable the same as it was using the variable that my name changed variable was linked to in the structure.
2.The two major changes that I would make for the program to save the end game results would be to save the final results to a structure, by having it feature a certain method of being able to store the results. I would also have it save to another file within the ide since then that separate file would not be affected by anything that happens in the main file. Then al I would have to do would be to call on it to display the previous end game results.
3.The part that I spent the most time on was trying to figure out how to display the board to the user. To overcome this problem, I looked at previous readings and tried to see if I could get any ideas from it. Eventually, I came up with the idea of using parallel arrays, since I knew with them I would be able to print out the data stored in the arrays beside each other.

In this workshop, I've learned how to make basic programs on C, how to utilize the printf command, as well as how to upload files to the matrix server. SSH stands for secure shell, it is what allows us to securely login into the matrix server and share data between two computers. I used SSH to login into the matrix server so I could then upload my files and submit it, but to do that I would need SFTP. SFTP stands for secure shell transfer protocol, and it is built over SSH to allow us to move files that are encrypted by it from point to another, this what I used to upload and submit files on the matrix.

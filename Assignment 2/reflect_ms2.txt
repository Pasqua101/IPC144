1. One of my most favourite functions from the string library would have to be the function strlen. While the function itself is pretty basic, it helped to simplify quite a few things in my code. Since, if I want to count the length of a string, I don’t have to run it through a for loop that I have created just to determine the size of it. Instead, I can use run the string I created through strlen and to find the length of the string and save some time while doing it. For example, with the function getCString that was created in commonHelpers.c, I had to create two loops, one to count the length of the string and the other to determine if the size of the string is more than, less than, or equal to the required size for it. Since I now can use the string library, all I had to do was call the function strlen in and then determine if the number returned from the size of the string is the required length for the user’s inputted string. While it may sound like it hasn’t done much, the function strlen has helped me to simplify quite a few parts in my code making it a little easier for me to work.
2. The functions I created for milestones 1 and 2 were ticketStatus, passwordChecker and getStringAllCaps. I created the function ticketStatus to help me view the information of a ticket to see if it is still active or not. This was done by looking at the value of the ticket status in the Account struct and seeing if there is a value of 0 or 1 and then I would display all of the related values to those specific tickets. The function passwordChecker was created to check the password attempts of a user, for example I would use strcmp to see if the netered password if the correct password for the account, if it wasn’t then I would add one to the count variable until it reached 3. If it did reach three then I returned a number from the function that would send the user back to the start of the program. My final function I created, which was getStringAllCaps would take in a pointer of the country string, and then it I would call on the function putchar and toupper to convert any lowercases in the string to being an uppercase. These are the functions I created for both milestones 1 and 2.

1. To link related data for any dataset, I would use a for loop since it allowed me to print out the data stored in the arrays by the size of them. This worked out great for when I was printing out the data stored in the array, since all of the arrays made were the same size. Meaning that I can print out everything in them without missing out on anything.
2. It’s common practice to iterate arrays with a value of 0 instead of 1, because usually when you start counting you start from 0. Or even when you’re taking measurements for a something, you wouldn’t start at 1 cm, you would start at 0 cm when you’re taking measurements. An example of me counting from zero for an array in this workshop would be when I was using for loops to add up the values stored in my array to my total for the selected priority. 
3. If I was explaining how an array works to a child between the ages of 5 and 8, I would compare it to a list, since an array holds a list of values entered. My explanation would be as follows. An array works like a list or even a basket. Let’s say you have a basket, and you want to put 8 apples into it. So, in array form you want it to hold 8 values, that’s how big you want it to be. Then you put your apples into that basket, that’s essentially like you adding in the data you want the array to hold. Now, if you want to locate one of the apples you put in your basket, all you would have to do is to specify the number of the saved data in your array, which would be a number from 0 to 7, since zero is the number that you would start counting with. That is essentially how an array works.
